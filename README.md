# SaturnusDB
Some DB Engine from a dark room to see the light

I've always wanted to build something big and now I have the courage to do it 

Why Saturnus? 
I would actually pick Saturn as my fav planet, it's surrounded by a ring system but it's far away from other planets, 
like me I want always to communicate with smart and knowledgeable people, but getting surrounded by non-sense
